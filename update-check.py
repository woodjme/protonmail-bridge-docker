Automated version bump from `{current_version}` to `{version}`.

**Before merging:**
- Check the [upstream release notes]({upstream_url}) for any new system dependencies or breaking changes.
- Confirm the test build below passes. If it fails, a new dependency likely needs to be added to the Dockerfile.
